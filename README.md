# Azure Order-to-Cash Analytics Platform

An end-to-end data engineering and analytics solution that converts operational business transactions into financial and operational decision intelligence.

This project models a real company Order-to-Cash (O2C) lifecycle and demonstrates how raw operational records become CFO-level reporting.

## Business Problem

Companies collect transactional data from multiple operational systems:
- Orders system
- Shipping system
- Billing system
- Payments system

The problem:
Data exists but leadership cannot answer critical questions:

• Why is cash collection delayed?  
• Which customers create revenue vs risk?  
• Which shipments impact invoice cycle time?  
• Where is revenue leakage occurring?

This project builds a full analytics platform to solve that.

## End-to-End Workflow

Raw Transactions → Data Lake → ETL Processing → SQL Warehouse → Data Model → BI Dashboard → Business Decisions

---

## Solution Architecture

Operational CSV data is ingested into a cloud storage layer, validated and transformed through a Python ETL pipeline, structured into a dimensional warehouse model, and exposed to Power BI for analytics.

---

## Data Engineering Pipeline

### 1. Raw Data Layer (Azure Blob Storage)
Contains unprocessed operational records:
- customers
- orders
- shipments
- invoices
- payments

This simulates ERP system exports.

### 2. ETL Processing (Python)
Script: `etl/otc_etl_with_validation.py`

ETL performs:
- schema validation
- null handling
- date standardization
- duplicate removal
- business rule validation
- referential integrity checks

### 3. Data Warehouse (SQL)

Structured relational warehouse built using fact and dimension design.

**Fact Tables**
- FactOrders
- FactInvoices
- FactPayments
- FactShipments

**Dimension Tables**
- DimCustomer
- DimDate
- DimProduct

Star schema enables BI performance and business readability.

### 4. Semantic Layer (SQL Views)
Business-friendly views created:
- revenue view
- collection aging
- customer performance
- shipment delay metrics

### 5. Analytics Layer (Power BI)
Power BI connects to warehouse and produces KPI reporting dashboards.
